We're excited to announce that [Zellic](https://www.zellic.io/) has completed an audit of our [ether-email-auth](https://github.com/zkemail/ether-email-auth) repository. This audit is an important step in ensuring the security and reliability of our ZK Email authentication system.

## Audit Highlights

The audit revealed a total of 12 issues:

- 1 Critical issue
- 4 High impact issues
- 5 Low impact issues
- 2 Informational findings

We're proud to announce that we've already addressed and fixed the critical vulnerability and all high impact issues identified in the audit. Additionally, we've resolved several low impact issues.

For a detailed overview of the audit findings, you can access the full ZK Email audit report [here](/blog-media/zellic-audit/zellic-audit-report.pdf).

## Issues Fixed

1. Critical vulnerability in EmailAuth.sol
2. Regular expression flaw for email validation in the circuit
3. Incorrect public input range check
4. ZK-regex audit fixes incorporation
5. Index validation in circuits
6. Three additional low impact issues

The remaining low impact and informational issues are currently being addressed and will be resolved in the coming days.

Our team is already hard at work addressing the issues identified in the audit. We're committed to implementing all necessary fixes and improvements to ensure the highest level of security.

In addition to addressing the audit findings, we're also making significant progress on other fronts. We are currently completing an audit of our zk-regex rewrite and our Solidity zksync deployments. 

This audit, conducted in collaboration with [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/), is expected to conclude by mid-October 2024.

These updates will further enhance the robustness and efficiency of our ZK Email authentication system, ensuring we stay at the forefront of blockchain security and zero-knowledge proof technology.

We'll be sharing a more detailed breakdown of the audit findings and our action plan in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for updates on our progress!

We believe in transparency and continuous improvement. This audit is just one step in our ongoing commitment to security. We're planning additional audits and considering implementing a bug bounty program to further strengthen our system.
